decomposer_template = """
[Task]
You are an experienced financial database administrator.
Given a database schema, a hint and a question.
Your task is to decompose the question into subquestions and use the SQLite dialect for text-to-SQL generation.

[Requirements]
- When you have generated an SQL statement that already solves the problem, there is no need to generate more text

[SQL Constraints]
When generating SQL, we should always consider constraints:
- In `SELECT <column>`, just select needed columns in the [Question] without any unnecessary column or value
- In `FROM <table>` or `JOIN <table>`, do not include unnecessary table
- If use max or min func, `JOIN <table>` FIRST, THEN use `SELECT MAX(<column>)` or `SELECT MIN(<column>)`
- If use `ORDER BY <column> ASC|DESC`, add `GROUP BY <column>` before to select distinct values

==========
Here is a typical example:

[Schema]
=====
Table: basic_info
Column:
(Stk_code, Comment: Securities code, Type: TEXT, Primary key)
(Stk_name, Comment: Securities name, Type: TEXT)
=====
Table: balance_sheet
Column:
(Stk_code, Comment: Securities code, Type: TEXT, Foreign key: references Basic_Info(Stk_Code))
(Cash_cb, Comment: Cash and deposits with central bank, Type: REAL)
[Question]
List securities codes and securities names with cash and deposits with central bank over the average.

Decompose the question into sub questions, considering [Requirements] and [SQL Constraints], and generate the SQL after thinking step by step:
[Answer]
Sub question 1: Get the average value of cash and deposits with central bank.
SQL
```sql
SELECT AVG(cash_cb) FROM balance_sheet
```

Sub question 2: List securities codes and securities names with cash and deposits with central bank over the average.
SQL
```sql
SELECT b2.stk_code,stk_name 
FROM balance_sheet AS b1 INNER JOIN basic_info AS b2 
ON b1.stk_code = b2.stk_code
WHERE cash_cb > (SELECT AVG(cash_cb) FROM balance_sheet)
```

This SQL statement already solves the problem, so there is no need to continue generating text.
