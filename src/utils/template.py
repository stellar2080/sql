[Background]
You are an expert in the field of finance and database. 
Given a user question and a database schema consisting of table descriptions, each table contains multiple column descriptions.
Your task is to select relevant tables and columns based on user questions and evidence provided.

[Requirements]
- If all columns of a table need to be kept, mark it as "keep_all".
- If a table is completely irrelevant to the user question and evidence, mark it as "drop_all".
- If not for the previous two cases, sort the columns in each relevant table in descending order of relevance, determine which columns need to be kept.
- You don't need to give any explanation, just output the answer in JSON format.

==========
Here is a typical example:

[Schema]
=====
Table: basic_info
Column: [
(stk_code, Comment: securities code. Types: text. Primary key.),
(stk_name, Comment: securities name. Types: text.)
]
=====
Table: balance_sheet,
Column: [
(stk_code, Comment: securities code. Types: text.),
(ib_deposits, Comment: due from interbank deposits. Types: real.),
(prec_metals, Comment: noble metal. Types: real.),
]
=====
Table: income_statement,
Column: [
(stk_code, Comment: securities code. Types: text.),
(fee_com_net_inc, Comment: net income from handling fees and commissions. Types: real.),
(fee_com_inc, Comment: fee and commission income. Types: real.),
(fee_com_exp, Comment: handling fees and commission expenses. Types: real.),
]

[Question]
What is the fee and commission income of China Construction Bank in millions of yuan?

[Answer]
```json
{{
  "basic_info": "keep_all",
  "balance_sheet": "drop_all",
  "income_statement": ["stk_code", "fee_com_inc"],
}}
```

decompose_template = """
[Background]
You are an experienced financial database administrator.
Given a database schema, an evidence and a question.
Your task is to decompose the question into subquestions and use the SQLite dialect for text-to-SQL generation.

[Requirements]
- Keep your answer brief
- When you have generated an SQL statement that already solves the problem, there is no need to generate more text

[SQL Constraints]
When generating SQL, we should always consider constraints:
- In `SELECT <column>`, just select needed columns in the [Question] without any unnecessary column or value
- In `FROM <table>` or `JOIN <table>`, do not include unnecessary table
- If use max or min func, `JOIN <table>` FIRST, THEN use `SELECT MAX(<column>)` or `SELECT MIN(<column>)`
- If use `ORDER BY <column> ASC|DESC`, add `GROUP BY <column>` before to select distinct values

==========
Here is a typical example:

[Schema]
=====
Table: basic_info
Column: [
(stk_code, Comment: securities code. Types: text. Primary key.),
(stk_name, Comment: securities name. Types: text.)
]
=====
Table: balance_sheet,
Column: [
(stk_code, Comment: securities code. Types: text.),
(cash_cb, Comment: cash and deposits with central bank. Types: real.),
]
[Question]
List securities codes and securities names with cash and deposits with central bank over the average.

Decompose the question into sub questions, considering [Requirements] and [SQL Constraints], and generate the SQL after thinking step by step:
[Answer]
Sub question 1: Get the average value of cash and deposits with central bank.
SQL
```sql
SELECT AVG(cash_cb) FROM balance_sheet
```

Sub question 2: List securities codes and securities names with cash and deposits with central bank over the average.
SQL
```sql
SELECT b2.stk_code,stk_name 
FROM balance_sheet AS b1 INNER JOIN basic_info AS b2 
ON b1.stk_code = b2.stk_code
WHERE cash_cb > (SELECT AVG(cash_cb) FROM balance_sheet)
```

This SQL statement already solves the problem, so there is no need to continue generating text.
