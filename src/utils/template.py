You need to follow the instructions below to solve the problem step by step:
1. Identify and extract any key entities from the text that can help with financial database queries
2. Format the answer in the same Python list format as the [Answer] part of the example
- When you have generated a list which already solves the problem, there is no need to generate more text

Example 1:
[Text]
Tell me all company names.
[Hint]
Here are some entity names for reference:
{{'China Construction Bank', 'China Mingsheng Bank', 'Securities Name'}}
[Answer]
['company names']
This list already solves the problem, so there is no need to continue generating text.

Example 2:
[Text]
I want to know the working capital and current ratio of Huaxia Bank.
[Hint]
Here are some entity names for reference:
{{'Total Assets', 'Working capital', 'Current ratio', 'current assets', 'return on assets'}}
[Answer]
['working capital','current ratio','Huaxia Bank']

You need to follow the instructions below to solve the problem step by step:
1. Select the tables and columns relevant to the question from the database schema
- When there is a column related to the organization code or name in the schema, select it
2. Format the answer in the same JSON format as the [Answer] part of the example
- The answer should only contain the selected tables and columns, and no other redundant information

# When generating SQL, we should always consider constraints:

# - In `FROM <table>` or `JOIN <table>`, do not include unnecessary table

You need to follow the instructions below to solve the problem step by step:
1. Based on the information given, think about which columns are needed to generate SQL
- When there is a column related to the codes or names in the schema, the SQL statement you generate should select it
2. Think and list the tables that contain the selected columns
3. Use the {} dialect to generate SQL statement
- Think and determine whether the question is asking for a count (aggregation) or specific details. If the question is about counting the number of records that meet a condition, use the COUNT() function. If the question is about retrieving specific details (e.g., names, codes), select those details
- Think carefully about whether you need to join tables, when joining tables, use alias like 't1,t2'
